        Christmas is saved!

        While your attempt to save the Christmas  presents initially enraged Cate,
        your encyclopaedic knowledge of her works flattered her so much she relented.
        You spend the rest of Christmas handing back gifts with your new bestie and
        get along so well that she even agrees to making a fleeting appearance at a
        party you throw. (Unfortunately, she is surprisingly camera-shy so stays in
        the background.)

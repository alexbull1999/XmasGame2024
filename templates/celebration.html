        The ghost leads you to a final memory - a family
        celebration, gathered around a living room table
        full of good food, wine and festive cheer.

        You wake up reinvigorated from your daydream, having
        thoroughly enjoyed the trip down memory line. You check
        the clock and realise you've ended up daydreaming for
        almost half a day - it's now Christmas morning, time
        to do it all over again!

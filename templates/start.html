        <h2>Twas the Night Before Christmas...</h2>
        <p>
            ...and all through the house,<br>
            Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.<br>
            Presents were wrapped, stockings hung with care,<br>
            But a twist of fate was soon in the air.<br><br>

            Nana Tina sat down with her tea in hand,<br>
            When she heard a loud bangâ€”oh, this wasn't planned!<br>
